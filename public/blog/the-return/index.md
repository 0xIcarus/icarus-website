# Where have you been?

- Life has been pretty fast paced lately. I've been working, doing college, writing exams, writing a whole bunch of personal side projects and also trying to not go crazy at the same time.

# What are your plans for now?

- Well, I initially thought I would drop out and just write code and make money. It's not that I can not still do that. I'd love to, but over the months, I've come to realize the grim reality; which is basically me figuring out that perhaps a college degree wont hurt. Ultimately, I'm going to have to do away with my mindset of "college is a scam, and doesn't cater to true meritocracy. Oh we don't do any _actual_ engineering here!!!". It could just be my dorm room philosophizing run amok.

# What's next?

- Summer is coming, which means I am going to be busy with a lot more work. Internships, job, college work and so on. And since I've decided to continue college, I'll probably have to study more too.

# This blog

- Now that I have a little more time, I think it's time I start blogging more. I'll probably post a few dev logs, a few ctf walkthroughs and perhaps maybe even start a little youtube channel.

### Goodbye... for now.

- Remember, hack the planet.
